## About me

Hi! I'm Gabriela, I have graduated in software engineering and have been working with it since then.

Here https://gabibguti.github.io/ I have put up a small portfolio (and it is forever a work in progress).

I currently work as a software engineer at Google within GOSST team. If you wanna learn more about GOSST, keep on reading!

## About GOSST :ghost:
![GOSST team logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRSTBmlUUAAXvry.jpg)

GOSST was created as a response to the current scenario of [increasing attacks on supply chain projects][supply-chain-attacks]. The team counts with experienced open-source contributors and works along with the Open Source Security Foundation ([OpenSSF][ossf]) to develop and spread solutions to make open softwares safer at scale. You can read more about Google initiatives on open source on [this blogpost][open-source-on-google].

More specifically, I'm part of a sub-team responsible for our direct contact with the Open Source community. We work around [critical open source projects][critical-projects] to help increase security, in any aspect or concern that might be relevant. As a team, our goal is to:

* Build individual analyses and approaches for each project.
* Evaluate and suggest solutions or enhancements that would better fit the repository and not overcharge the maintainers.
* Welcome and conduct discussions about our suggestion or about any security solutions the maintainers prefer, as we can surely provide specific help according to their demands.
* If possible and wanted, implement the changes ourselves and create PRs to contribute with the discussed improvements.
* Collect any kinds of feedback, as we work closely with OpenSSF and any complains would be kindly heard.

### Security Solutions

In regard to the GOSST/OpenSSF security solutions that help securing the supply-chain, we can name:

* [Scorecard][scorecard]: automated checks to evaluate and suggest security practices on your own project or your dependencies
* [SLSA (pronounced "salsa")][slsa]: a check-list of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in your projects, businesses or enterprises
* [Sigstore][sigstore]: a new standard for signing, verifying and protecting software
* [OSS-FUZZ][oss-fuzz]: a tool for fuzzing at scale and find bugs in critical projects, now fuzzing 800+ projects in 6 languages
* [OSV][osv]: a precise, human - and machine - readable database of vulnerabilities that maps affected software versions across open source ecosystems
