## About me

Hi! I'm Gabriela, I have graduated in software engineering and have been working with it since then.

Here https://gabibguti.github.io/ I have put up a small portfolio (and it is forever a work in progress).

I currently work as a software engineer at Google, and for some time I worked in this great team called GOSST. If you wanna learn more about GOSST, keep on reading!

### About GOSST :ghost:
![GOSST team logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRSTBmlUUAAXvry.jpg)

GOSST was created as a response to the current scenario of [increasing attacks on supply chain projects][supply-chain-attacks]. The team counts with experienced open-source contributors and works along with the Open Source Security Foundation ([OpenSSF][ossf]) to develop and spread solutions to make open softwares safer at scale. You can read more about Google initiatives on open source on [this blogpost][open-source-on-google].

#### Security Solutions

In regard to the GOSST/OpenSSF security solutions that help securing the supply-chain, we can name:

* [Scorecard][scorecard]: automated checks to evaluate and suggest security practices on your own project or your dependencies
* [SLSA (pronounced "salsa")][slsa]: a check-list of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in your projects, businesses or enterprises
* [Sigstore][sigstore]: a new standard for signing, verifying and protecting software
* [OSS-FUZZ][oss-fuzz]: a tool for fuzzing at scale and find bugs in critical projects, now fuzzing 800+ projects in 6 languages
* [OSV][osv]: a precise, human - and machine - readable database of vulnerabilities that maps affected software versions across open source ecosystems
